CSDataQuick
===========

This project brings EPICS control system data into QML/QtQuick programming.

The QML module provides a CSData object to model `CSDataQuick.Data` control system data, and a collection
of visual QtQuick items to control/monitor the data. These visual items are ready to be used
inside the Qt Quick Designer by a drag-n-drop.

A viewer program can then display the created QML files. For convenience it can also parse ADL files
and create the display with equivalent QtQuick items.
